    <h2>- Lore -</h2>
      <p>
        Sam, a gamer, discovered Nintendo's `Super Mario World` but quickly grew bored of it. 
        He later found an application called `Mar.V2.exe` that claimed to expand the game to reality. 
        After running it multiple times with no success, he gave up. 
        Later, he found a new app called **Yosh's-Reign.smc** in place of Super Mario World. 
        Intrigued by the notification "Rewrite complete," he ran the app and saw a changed title screen with a Yoshi. <br><br>
        
        Upon starting the game, the screen flashed red, and he was forced to play as Mario with the name "Sam" displayed.
        The game world was now fall-themed and different from the original. 
        In a stage resembling Yoshi's house, he encountered a blood-stained Yoshi named Yosh, who offered him a choice to help destroy the Mushroom Kingdom. 
        Bored with the original game, Sam accepted the offer, and the game was renamed to **HELP.smc**, marking the beginning of his new adventure. <br><br>
