      <p>
        One day, Sam downloaded a ROM hack of Super Mario World to his computer.<br>
        He decided to link it to his pc application called "Mar.v2.exe" and proceeded to play it.<br>
        To him, he was just having fun playing Super Mario World... but something happened to him shortly after.<br>
        He started doing very weird things to the game and it started to act different.<br>
        This is the last footage of him playing it on his emulator before he went missing.<br>
      </p>
