## - Lore -

Sam, a gamer, discovered Nintendo's `Super Mario World` but quickly grew bored of it. He later found an application called `Mar.V2.exe` that claimed to expand the game to reality. After running it multiple times with no success, he gave up. Later, he found a new app called **Yosh's-Reign.smc** in place of Super Mario World. Intrigued by the notification "Rewrite complete," he ran the app and saw a changed title screen with a Yoshi. Upon starting the game, the screen flashed red, and he was forced to play as Mario with the name "Sam" displayed.

The game world was now fall-themed and different from the original. In a stage resembling Yoshi's house, he encountered a blood-stained Yoshi named Yosh, who offered him a choice to help destroy the Mushroom Kingdom. Bored with the original game, Sam accepted the offer, and the game was renamed to **HELP.smc**, marking the beginning of his new adventure.
