## HELP.smc

### Overview:
This release introduces the BPS patch for **HELP.smc**, allowing you to experience the eerie, suspenseful gameplay with ease. Apply this patch to your legally obtained copy of **Super Mario World** to dive into the creepy world of **HELP.smc**.

### What's New:
- **BPS Patch Format**: Prevented direct distribution of the original ROM so Nintendo doesn't kill me.
- **Enhanced Stability**: Ensures smoother gameplay and better performance.
- **Updated Lore**: Revised to better align with the current narrative.
