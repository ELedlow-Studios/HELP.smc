One day, Sam downloaded a ROM hack of Super Mario World to his computer.  
He decided to link it to his pc application called "Mar.v2.exe" and proceeded to play it.  
To him, he was just having fun playing Super Mario World... but something happened to him shortly after.  
He started doing very weird things to the game and it started to act different.  
This is the last footage of him playing it on his emulator before he went missing.
